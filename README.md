## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not have to use any outside resources other than the ones that were hyperlinked within the instructions. I found
them quite useful actually. However, a resource which I did play around with but did not implement from as part of my 
submission is a website called Coolers.co which my professor had told us about from where I could find very beautiful 
colors similar to the website which was provided to us in the instructions]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[It was a bit challenging to follow along on the JavaScript code. I seemed to have felt comfortable with the HTML and the
CSS. Hence, I tried to read the extra sections and tried to see where the connections are between functions and variables used.
However, I do feel that I may need a little more explanation and observation to fully comprehend why exactly the JavaScript code
works the way it does and how it allows the implementation to work out. I also found it slightly challenging to navigate Glitch in the start
however, by using it and following the instructions overtime I became better at understanding how to navigate it. I am quite glad to actually
have found out about this website. Another challenge I had was trying to figure out how to change the code on my own to implement 
or change features. I tried to overcome that by simply trying to manipulate the code the way I understood it. Although it did not work, and I 
simply undid the changes it makes me curious why what I did did not work. Thank you for the thorough instructions and I especially liked the use of pictures to better since it better explained what we had to do.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[How can you make your web application have multiple pages using this software? How do you
add images and animation to the application because I am still confused on how to do that aspect? 
How can I publish something I make without having to by myself a domain or server to publish my website?
Also, how can I debug my code more easily. The console aspect is nice to see, but I do not feel confident.
What security issues can I run into in web development and how can I avoid them? How can I use the user input to change the display of my webpage? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Definitely try to add more features! But also trying to better comprehend the code. Like I said I would be interested in 
dissecting the JavaScript code a little more. I would also have spent a little bit of time getting to know few fundamental JavaScript
functions or code methodologies so I could better use them. I would have liked to have spent time to see why the audio part was working
because that seemed to be something that was interesting. I would also have liked to played the game with other people! It would also have been great to add my personal touch to the application. For example, to make it more accessible to people with special needs since this is a game about hearing we could try to add some sort of vibration aspect so the user can feel different vibrations and then respond. ]
